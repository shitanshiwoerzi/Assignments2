Grug grows suspicious of the Betterman parents, Phil and Hope,  as they secretly plan to break up his daughter Eep with her loving boyfriend Guy to ensure that their daughter Dawn has a loving and smart partner to protect her.  Searching for a safer habitat, the prehistoric Crood family discovers an idyllic, walled-in paradise that meets all of its needs. Unfortunately, they must also learn to live with the Bettermans -- a family that's a couple of steps above the Croods on the evolutionary ladder. As tensions between the new neighbors start to rise, a new threat soon propels both clans on an epic adventure that forces them to embrace their differences, draw strength from one another, and survive together.",
